Nano versions of Yolo 8, 9, 10 and 11 were trained on customized vehicle datasets which contains 586 training datasets and 90 validation datasets. 
Transfer learning was used to fine-tuned the models for improved precision and recall. Subsequently, learning curves, confusion matrix was deployed in 
order to access the performance and to validate the models accuracies and generalization capabilities. The models were tested on validation images,
unseen test image and a test video to demonstrate its practical application and effectiveness. Yolo 11 outperforms others generally in metrics like precision, 
recall, and fitness. It also boasts of consistent performance across several scenarios which includes detecting images with overlapping boundaries and varying 
confidence thresholds.

Yolov11 performs best due to its very high fitness score, precision and recall. It is therefore the most balanced for object detection. It also ensure consistent performance accross several scenarios which includes detecting objects with overlapping boundries and varying confidence thresholds
